## Description
For the Winter Quarter term of ME 405's lab, we were assigned by Dr. John Ridgely 
to create a ***heat-sensing foam dart blaster turret***. Its capabilites include full 
autonomous motion, aiming, and firing. For aiming it would use a lab provided 
thermal infrared camera (model MLX90640) to find its intended target.

Our device was tested against others on Dueling Day where along the ends of a long 
table each opposing device was secured and a single member of each team stood behind 
their respective device. Upon the "duel" beginning, members would move within a 5 
second period, where afterwards they must remain frozen in their chosen position and 
each oppposing device must aim and fire against their opponent within 10 seconds 
afterwards. For further clarification upon project and Dueling Day rules, you may go
